# Java Collections Task
Design and implement a Photo Management System using Java Collections Framework. The system should allow users to upload photos, add tags, and search for photos using tags or metadata efficiently, metadata such as tags (one or more), date, and location name.
Bonus: location can be latitude and longitude, and for example, when searching using Cairo, ensure that the location belongs to the Cairo zone (latitude, longitude, radius)

I used Sets and Lists and Maps form the Collections API for this task.
